## Deployment Configuration for HTTPS

1. **Obtain SSL Certificate**:
   Obtain an SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt or another CA.

2. **Configure Nginx**:
   Update your Nginx configuration to redirect HTTP to HTTPS and use the obtained SSL certificate.

3. **Reload Nginx**:
   After updating the configuration, reload or restart Nginx to apply changes.

## Security Review

### Implemented Measures

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: 
  All HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS using `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT`.

- **HSTS**: 
  Configured HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to ensure browsers only connect over HTTPS.

- **Secure Cookies**: 
  Enforced secure transmission of session and CSRF cookies by enabling `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` and `CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE`.

- **Secure Headers**: 
  Implemented headers such as `X_FRAME_OPTIONS`, `SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`, and `SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER` to prevent clickjacking, MIME-sniffing, and XSS attacks.

### Potential Areas for Improvement

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
  Consider adding a CSP to further protect against XSS and data injection attacks.

- **Regular Security Audits**:
  Regularly review and update security settings to adapt to new threats and best practices.
